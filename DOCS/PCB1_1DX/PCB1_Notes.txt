1DX uses the CYW4343W :: Same as in Arduino GIGA


while 1YN uses CYW43439 > This is the other chip on hand for the post GIGA recommended chip

NXP SDK Sources have these 5 'chips' called out for function
#if defined(SD8978) || defined(SD8987) || defined(SD8801)
#if !defined(SD8801)
#ifndef RW610

Need to find one that is closest workalike to the 1DX
